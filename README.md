# edgeDetector

This Edge Detection program is an image processing technique used to find discontinuities in digital images. 
Create an image edge detector that adheres to the following requirements. The program will be written in C. 
It will take one or more P6 images as input and apply a Laplacian filter to the images using threads. For each 
input image, the program will create a new P6 image as output that has the edges of the input image.
